# euptfv2
Updated European hydraulic pedotransfer functions with communicated uncertainties in the predicted variables (euptfv2)

This repository includes the R scripts used to derive the updated European prediction algorithms to compute soil hydraulic parameters from easily available soil properties. The new algorithms lead to significantly better predictions and provide built-in prediction uncertainty computation. The influence of predictor variables on predicted soil hydraulic properties is explored.
A website (https://ptfinterface.rissac.hu) and R package euptf2 facilitate easy application of the updated prediction algorithms.
